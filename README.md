# Beliefs
It's hard to be intentional and rigorous about every part of your life. Much of our opinions are based on trusted confidants, news, and expert summaries rather than a direct, thorough survey of available research. This repo represents the issues and beliefs that are too important to me to rely on this.

Each folder represents an area, with my current thinking on the topic along with all of the sources I have found so far to justify my opinion. The current status of my beliefs:

## Forming
- [How dangerous is artificial intelligence?](artificial-intelligence/summary.md)
- [Is social media a net positive or negative?](social-media/summary.md)

## Relatively stable
None yet. I just started the project ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
